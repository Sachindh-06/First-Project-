      title: "What is a Planet?",
      category: "Basics",
      readTime: "5 min",
      content: "A planet is a celestial body that orbits a star, has sufficient mass to assume a roughly spherical shape, and has cleared its orbital neighborhood of other objects. This definition, established by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, helps distinguish planets from other celestial bodies like asteroids and dwarf planets."
    },
    {
      title: "The Formation of Planetary Systems",
      category: "Science",
      readTime: "8 min",
      content: "Planetary systems form from collapsing clouds of gas and dust called nebulae. As the cloud contracts under gravity, it forms a rotating disk with a star at the center. Planets form from the leftover material in this disk through a process called accretion, where small particles stick together to form larger and larger objects."
    },
    {
      title: "Habitable Zones and Life",
      category: "Astrobiology",
      readTime: "6 min",
      content: "The habitable zone, or 'Goldilocks zone,' is the region around a star where liquid water could exist on a planet's surface. This zone varies depending on the star's temperature and size. Planets in this zone are considered the most likely candidates for hosting life as we know it."
    },
    {
      title: "Exoplanet Detection Methods",
      category: "Technology",
      readTime: "10 min",
      content: "Astronomers use several methods to detect exoplanets: the transit method observes dimming when planets pass in front of their stars, the radial velocity method detects wobbles in stellar motion, direct imaging captures light from planets, and gravitational microlensing uses gravity as a lens to magnify distant objects."
    },
    {
      title: "Rogue Planets: Wanderers of Space",
      category: "Discovery",
      readTime: "7 min",
      content: "Rogue planets are planetary-mass objects that orbit no star, wandering freely through space. They may have been ejected from their original solar systems or formed independently. These dark, cold worlds challenge our understanding of planetary formation and may be more common than previously thought."
    },
    {
      title: "The Search for Extraterrestrial Life",
      category: "Astrobiology",
      readTime: "12 min",
      content: "Scientists search for life beyond Earth by looking for biosignatures - signs of biological activity in planetary atmospheres. These might include oxygen, methane, or other gases that suggest the presence of living organisms. The James Webb Space Telescope is revolutionizing this search with unprecedented sensitivity."

  const faqs = [
    {
      question: "How many exoplanets have been discovered?",
      answer: "As of 2024, over 5,000 exoplanets have been confirmed, with thousands more candidates awaiting verification. The Kepler Space Telescope and TESS mission have been instrumental in these discoveries."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes a planet habitable?",
      answer: "A habitable planet typically needs liquid water, a stable atmosphere, the right temperature range, and protection from harmful radiation. The planet's distance from its star, composition, and magnetic field all play crucial roles."
    },
    {
      question: "Could we ever travel to exoplanets?",
      answer: "With current technology, interstellar travel would take thousands of years. However, concepts like solar sails, fusion rockets, and even theoretical warp drives could potentially reduce travel times to decades or centuries in the future."
    },
    {
      question: "What are hot Jupiters?",
      answer: "Hot Jupiters are gas giant planets that orbit very close to their host stars, completing an orbit in just a few days. They're called 'hot' because their proximity to the star results in extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 1000Â°C."
    },
    {
      question: "How do we know the composition of exoplanets?",
      answer: "Scientists analyze the light from exoplanets using spectroscopy. When starlight passes through a planet's atmosphere, different molecules absorb specific wavelengths, creating a unique 'fingerprint' that reveals the atmospheric composition."

      question: "How many moons does Jupiter have?",
      options: ["79", "95", "67", "82"],

      question: "What defines the habitable zone around a star?",
      options: ["Where planets can have atmospheres", "Where liquid water can exist", "Where rocky planets form", "Where gas giants cannot exist"],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "The habitable zone is the region around a star where temperatures allow liquid water to exist on a planet's surface - not too hot and not too cold."
